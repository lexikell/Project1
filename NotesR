#notes on using R/Rstudio

#Rob H on Youtube uses unix (linux?) language within R 
    - so I think I was just confused when reading the bioconductor code, but I guess I can just call things using unix language
    - which makes sense bc ppl say that R has many ways to do one thing
    - also bc I *think* I could technically download python within Rstudio and run python within (and vice versa with python)

use "<-" to assign a variable

#Rstudio
- top left holds your scripts
- bottom left is your terminal
    - either R specific (console) or your local terminal (can probably ssh in there(?))
- bottom right is your help/programs/whatever
    - also where you see any graphs
- top right has your environment info 
    - contains list of variables you have already set
- to run a script
    - can highlight script and hit "run" (or command+enter)
    - in your ternminal, can run R script using "Rscript" followed by the location of your script and script name
        - for ex) "Rscript /Users/lexikellington/R/rectangle.R"

#run on Compute canada
- use the normal bash script slurm job stats that you have on your .sh scripts, and then you can go straight to running your R script using "Rscript" function 
    - for example: "Rscript computation.R" would be your only line of code, as long as the .R is within the same directory you are currently in (otherwise, define that dir)

mir:
-srun before program? 
-send to email for run times
    -it will make a "slurm" file on the run error 
    -and then see if you close your cmpt this will not fail (she says itll be good)
-emacs is her nano 
-add the bioconductor app that they don't have
-compute canada wiki for nodes selection
