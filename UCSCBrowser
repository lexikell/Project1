#Upload your BigWig files to the UCSC genome browser and compare your data with others

#BigWigs from Deeptools (BamCompare using the sample and the control)
#To use the UCSC browser online (which is what they recommend) you add your data to a internet accessible server 
    #UCSC has info on this on their "Track Hubs" page https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html#Hosting
    #I used Cyverse 
    #Cyverse: moved files from CC to local and then uploaded to Cyverse
#Once your data is loaded with public access you can add your own "custom tracks"
    #Video help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvHihNbyCh8

#My tracks
#colours are red, blue, and green, respectively

#Can paste this link into the "custom tracks" upload and then it'll be available on the genome browser
